# Sample Site How-To

## What is this?

This is an extremely simple website created to help test and develop the
debugging plugin. The site itself is just the buttons along the
top-left corner of the webpage. Clicking on one of these will fire
its respective function.

The plugin provides all the rest of the functionality.

## Setup and Running

1. build the plugin. [See the main README for instructions](../../../README.md).
2. open up `./public/index.html` in your browser of choice.
